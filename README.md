- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndreFernandoF

- 👀 I’m interested in changing my career to be a programmer because it's something that I've always wanted. 
I've worked in industry around 14 years, and I believe that is going to help me because I've learned a lot about how to work as team, helping people, getting better everyday, being polite even in difficult moments or under preassure, I've also learned that the communication is the secret to reach Goals in our professional life...

- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS and JS and soon I'm going to learn Python on the college, also I have been studyng English everyday to improve my career as a progammer...

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of company as an intern, as I started my studyng few months ago I just want experience in the job market...


- 📫 How to reach me:   andre.fragoso84@gmail.com...


-Best Regards-
